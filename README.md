# Huntpad

Huntpad is a notepad application with features that are particularly useful to penetration testers and bug hunters - a collection of common injection string generators, hash generators, encoders and decoders, HTML and text manipulation functions, and so on, coupled with syntax highlighting and ability to execute scripts in over 10 programming languages. For more details, visit the [Huntpad homepage](http://www.syhunt.com/en/?n=Products.SyhuntHuntpad).

## Directories

* `/packs` - contents of the uncompressed pack files *Huntpad.scx* and *HuntScript.scx*
* `/src` - the main executable source and built-in resource files

## Compiling

For compiling Huntpad, you will just need [Catarinka](https://github.com/felipedaragon/catarinka) and [pLua](https://github.com/felipedaragon/pLua-XE).
 
There is no need to install third-party components in the IDE - you can just add the dependencies listed above to the library path and hit compile. It compiles under Delphi 10 Seattle down to XE2.

When starting up, Huntpad will require the [Underscript](https://github.com/felipedaragon/underscript) Lua library compiled and some packed resource files from [Sandcat](https://github.com/felipedaragon/sandcat) (*Common.pak* and *Resources.pak*) to work.
